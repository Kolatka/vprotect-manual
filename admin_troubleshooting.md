# Troubleshooting

Storware vProtect log directory located in `/opt/vprotect/logs` is the first place to check for reason of errors. All of log files are also accesible from `Logs` section in web UI.

CLI interface records messages in `vprotect_client.log` files under the node subdirectory. In the same directory you can also find `vprotect_daemon.log` files which contain all engine messages.

Web UI has 2 directories where it stores log files:

* `appserver` which has all messages comming from application server which hosts web UI
* `api` which has all messages related to the API \(and Web UI\)

Aditionally TSM \(Spectrum Protect related errors can also be found in dsierror.log in the `/opt/vprotect` directory.

Common issues:

1. UI dissappears after a while \(server responds with 404 error\):
   * Red Hat based distributions have build-in mechanism to clean up tempoarary directory that may remove files related to vProtect UI.
   * Make sure that `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf` file contains the following lines:

     ```text
     x /tmp/payaramicro*tmp
     x /tmp/javamelody
     ```

   * This is configured during installation since v3.4 - update from older versions requires the following commands to be executed:

     ```text
     tmp=/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf
     grep -q -F 'x /tmp/payaramicro*tmp' $tmp || echo 'x /tmp/payaramicro*tmp' >> $tmp
     grep -q -F "x /tmp/javamelody" $tmp  || echo "x /tmp/javamelody" >> $tmp
     ```
2. Cannot access Web UI \(no response returned from the server\)
   * make sure `vprotect-server` service is running
   * make sure firewall 8181 \(or 443\) ports are opened
3. Index or backup tasks fail:
   * the most common error is a typo in hypervisor address or credentials 
   * use hypervisor module to modify hypervisor address or credentials
4. Backup/restore fails on the export task
   * please check node log files
   * IBM Spectrum protect provides numeric code in the backup status - please refer to `Client Messages and Application Programming Interface Return Codes` for the version of TSM \(Spectrum Protect\) that youâ€™re using. For version 7.1.2 you can use the following [link](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGSG7_7.1.2/com.ibm.itsm.msgs.client.doc/b_msgs_client.pdf)
5. Operation fails because of privileges:
   * make sure that location where you mount backup belongs to user `vprotect`
   * make sure your staging belongs to user `vprotect`
   * for RHV/oVirt/Oracle VM make sure NFS exports are owned by user `vprotect` so that all files are accessible both by vProtect and HV manager
6. RHV/oVirt - export is OK, but fails with file not found during store
   * if you're using multiple datacenters make sure to create separate subdirectories in your staging for each DC and create exports on the subdirectories level \(1 export corresponds to 1 export domain in RHV/oVirt\)
7. Backup not found error for ISP backup destination:
   * make sure you have time in sync and provided correct time zone that TSM server is using
8. Tasks are not executed
   * make sure node is running in `Nodes` section in UI
   * start node if necessary
   * if it fails to start check node log files for further messages
   * if the URL to the server has changed it is necessary to update it using `vprotect node -e` command to re-register node

To verify if services are running you can use:

* `systemctl status vprotect-server` for Server
* `systemctl status vprotect-node` for Node or `vprotect status`

## Collecting debug logs

Quite often Storware support will ask for debug logs for more in-depth troubleshooting. In order to do that please follow steps below.

### vProtect Node

1. Stop vprotect-node service:

   `systemctl stop vprotect-node`

2. Edit `/usr/bin/vprotect` file - there is a `LOG_LEVEL=...` variable and it should look like this `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and save the file.
3. Start vprotect-node service:

   `systemctl start vprotect-node`

4. Proceed with operations that need to be logged.
5. Then collect logs from `/opt/vprotect/logs/<NODE_NAME>` directory.

### **vProtect Server**

1. Stop vprotect-server service:

   `systemctl stop vprotect-server`

2. Rename `/opt/vprotect/log4j2.xml.sample` file to `/opt/vprotect/log4j2.xml`  - it is a logger config for vProtect Server and it already has debug enabled.
3. Start vprotect-server service:

   `systemctl start vprotect-node`

4. Proceed with operations that need to be logged.
5. Then collect logs from `/opt/vprotect/logs/api` and `/opt/vprotect/logs/appserver` directories.
