# Proxmox setup

Proxmomx environments require backup storage to be defined on each server. This storage must be location accessible from vProtect Node \(the simplest setup, when you use only 1 node, is to create NFS share for staging path on vProtect Node\)

1. Create storage from NFS share \(Content type: VZDump\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/setup_proxmox-editstorage%20%281%29.png)

   * Note that export must be set to use UID and GID of `vprotect` user
   * Example export configuration in `/etc/exports` to the selected hypervisor in RHV cluster:

     ```text
     /vprotect_data    PROXMOX_HOSTS(fsid=6,rw,sync,insecure,all_squash,anonuid=993,anongid=990)
     ```

     where `anonuid=993` and `anongid=990` should have correct UID and GID returned by command:

     ```text
     [root@vProtect3 ~]# id vprotect
     uid=993(vprotect) gid=990(vprotect) groups=990(vprotect)
     ```

2. Both import and export operations will be done using this NFS shares â€“ restore will be done directly to this storage domain, so you can easily import backup into Proxmox environment

   * backups must be restored to the export path \(node automatically changes names to the original paths that are recognized by Proxmox.

3. Name for storage must be later provided in node configuration \(`Hypervisor -> Proxmox` section\)
4. Proxmomx \(like KVM/Xen\) environments require to have correct entry in known\_hosts on the node:

   * it must be known\_hosts file that belongs to `vprotect` user
   * algorithm must be set to `ssh-rsa`

   **Example:**

   ```text
   sudo -u vprotect ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa root@HYPERVISOR
   ```

   * make sure to have in your Node Confiuration `known_hosts` file path \(in `KVM/Xen` section\) set to the location that is accessible for `vprotect` user - default `/opt/vprotect/.ssh/known_hosts`

## Public key authentication

Instead of using password authentication you also have public key alternative.

**Example:**

1. Generate key or use yours and store it as `/opt/vprotect/.ssh/id_rsa` \(make sure that `vprotect` user and group own the file\)
   * example key generation:

     ```text
     [root@vProtect3 vprotect]# sudo -u vprotect ssh-keygen
     Generating public/private rsa key pair.
     Enter file in which to save the key (/opt/vprotect/.ssh/id_rsa): 
     Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
     Enter same passphrase again: 
     Your identification has been saved in /opt/vprotect/.ssh/id_rsa.
     Your public key has been saved in /opt/vprotect/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
     The key fingerprint is:
     SHA256:86HSLKYwl7maDR7U1oIH1Y6VDtRFNJgHgfdjikg3VnQ vprotect@vProtect3
     The key's randomart image is:
     +---[RSA 2048]----+
     |   .o=+XE        |
     |   .o X...       |
     |  .  O o         |
     |  .+=.o +        |
     | .o+=o.oS..      |
     | ..o.+.o + .     |
     |  = + + + .      |
     | . O + o         |
     |  +.+            |
     +----[SHA256]-----+
     ```
2. use `ssh-copy-id` to upload your public key \(as `vprotect` user\) to the Proxmox host:

   ```text
   sudo -u vprotect ssh-copy-id -i /opt/vprotect/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@HYPERVISOR
   ```

3. Check if you're able to log into the hypervisor using local `vprotect` user without being asked for password:

   ```text
   [root@vProtect3 vprotect]# sudo -u vprotect ssh root@proxmox
   Last failed login: Mon Jan 29 17:54:01 CET 2018 from 10.50.1.107 on ssh:notty
   There was 1 failed login attempt since the last successful login.
   Last login: Mon Jan 29 17:54:39 2018 from 10.50.1.107
   [root@proxmox ~]# logout
   ```

4. Now you should be able to index VMs regardless of the password set for hypervisor \(key should be used instead\).
