# Installation

**Notice:** you may want to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3PnfXG5Fs4), which presents a complete vProtect setup with several virtualization platforms and backup providers.

We also encourage you to read [Getting started](../getting-started/) section if you haven't done that yet.

You have the installation options:

* [All-in-one quick installation](all-in-one-quick-installation.md)
* [Installation using Ansible playbooks](installation-using-ansible.md)
* [Installation with RPMs](installation-using-rpms.md)
* [vProtect Virtual Appliance deployment](../image/)

Then please continue with [Initial configuration](../initial_config/) steps. Remember to make sure you have your staging space configured \([Staging space configuration](staging-space-configuration.md)\).
