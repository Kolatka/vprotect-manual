# Licensing

We offer several licensing options, which allows you to choose the best fit for your use case. 

**Note:** Licensing options cannot be mixed within the one environment.

## Types

### per Host 

Here we license the number of physical hosts under the virtualization technology. With the host license, you can have an unlimited number of VMs or TBs. In case you have more than two sockets machines, then you need one host license per every two sockets. This is the most chosen option, as future hosts growth is well predictable, and you do not need to take care of dynamic VMs or TBs changes. 

### per VM 

Here we count the exact number of virtual machines that you are backing up. You can have any number of hosts or TBs. This option is a good fit for MSPs, to align your managed VM services pricing. 

### per TB 

Here we would like to meet requirements to align with front-end TB licensing. By 1TB steps, the only size of your storage being backed up matters. You can have as many hosts or VMs as you want. At some cases, this is the most effective licensing especially for smaller numbers of TBs.

### per Compute Node 

Here we come with a special option for our [Kubernetes](../deployment/protected-platforms/containers/kubernetes.md) or [Red Hat OpenShift](../deployment/protected-platforms/containers/red-hat-openshift.md) containerization platforms.
