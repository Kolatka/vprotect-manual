# Backup destinations

Backup destination is a description of the backup provider configuration and retention settings. Each VM group can be backed up to the selected backup destination. Backup destinations must be assigned to the nodes in the node configuration.

**Note:** removal of any backup destination leaves data in the backup provider without option to re-attach it in the future.

## Available properties

vProtect handles retention for all backup destinations except NetBackup. There are 4 properties that define how long backup should be kept in backup destination:

* `Retention (Full) - no. of versions to keep` - number of full backups
* `Retention (Inc.) - no. of versions to keep` - number of incremental backups
* `Retention (Full) - no. of days to keep` - number of days to keep full backup
* `Retention (Inc.) - no. of days to keep` - number of days to keep incremental backup

Whichever condition is met first \(either number of versions has been reached or backup is older than given limit\), it is removed from backup destination.

Additionally, there are also pre/post access command execution settings - details: [How to setup pre/post BD access command execution](admin_webui_pre_post_bd_access_cmd.md)

Each backup destination needs also a unique `Name` for easier identification in the configuration.

### File system

* `Paths` - list of storage paths accessible from the node where backups should be stored 
  * **note**: if more than one path is given vProtect will automatically balance each path and store file always in the path with the most free space available
  * **note**: you can only provide one path if deduplication is enabled
* `Encryption` - enables build-in encryption of the data at rest. Once enabled, new data being stored is going to be encrypted. 
  * **note:** this implies that file move is not possible even if single file system is used both for staging and backup destinations
* `Enable deduplication` - enables deduplication with VDO - you need to provide:
  * `Deduplication device` - VDO requires a block device used to store actual data 
    * **note:** this device will be initialized with a fresh VDO file system
  * `Mount deduplicated file system to a different directory than backup destination path` - **optional** - by default vProtect will mount deduplicated file sytem in the backup destination path \(the only one that can be provided\), however you can use this parameter to setup deduplicated file system that covers both staging space and backup destination
    * **example**: paths = `/vprotect_data/backups` but mount point for VDO and export path = `/vprotect_data`

### IBM Spectrum Protect

* `dsm.opt file path` - path to the `dsm.opt` configuration file on the node \(ISP API must be installed on all nodes that use ISP backup destination
* `ISP node name` - name of the node in ISP server to be used
* `ISP node password` - password for the ISP node to be used
* `ISP Server time zone` - time zone used by ISP server
* `Progress refresh rate (1/x of data size) - backup` - how often should progress be updated during backup - `x` times per backup size
* `Progress refresh rate (1/x of data size) - restore` - how often should progress be updated during restore - `x` times per backup size

**Note** that all backup destinations need to use all the same settings - only retention may differ for each backup destination

### Veritas NetBackup

* `Client home path` - directory of the NetBackup client \(needs to be installed and configured before running first tasks
* `Real export path`- NetBackup client requires export path \(staging space, default /vprotect\_data\) to be real directories instead of symlinks; if `/vprotect_data` is a symlink to e.g. `/data` then put `/data` in this field
* `Policy name` - name of the policy assigned in NetBackup to the client used by vProtect
* `Schedule name` - name of the schedule assigned in NetBackup to the client used by vProtect; backup schedules are controlled by vProtect, so no specific values should be configured in NetBackup
* `Client name` - optional field when multiple nodes need to access same NetBackup Server - each node is supposed to backup to seprate backup destination \(each pointing to the same NetBackup Server, but which different client name\)

### Dell EMC Avamar

* `MCCLI binary path` - path to your MCCLI client binary - i.e. `/usr/local/avamar/7.5.1-101/bin/mccli` 
* `Account` - account used by backup client - i.e. `/usr/local/avamar/7.5.1-101/bin/mccli`

### Dell EMC NetWorker

* `Server address` â€“ address of your Networker server

### S3

* `API URL (optional)` - optional if Amazon S3 is used, otherwise provide API URL for your S3-compatible backup provider
* `Access key` - your S3 access key
* `Secret key` - your S3 secret key
* `Backup mode` - mode that specifies if backups should be stored in one bucket or in separate buckets for each VM
  * Single bucket for all VMs - stores all backups in a single bucket \(default for Amazon S3\)
  * Single bucket \(without versioning support\) for all VMs - same as above, but 3rd-party solutions may not support object versioning - choose that to store object versions as separate objects
  * One bucket per VM - stores all backups in separate buckets \(note Amazon S3 may have limits on the number of buckets\)
* `Move old versions to other storage class` - instead of removing expired items vProtect will move S3 backup objects to a cheeper storage tiers \(Glacier/Deep Archive\) - when you enable this option you need to provide extended retention settings \(number of additional versions and time\)
* `Record backup time after store` - some 3rd party solutions record object version after data transfer, enable this options only if you experience `Backup not found` issues.
* `Bucket name (for SINGLE_BUCKET only)` - single bucket name to be used for backups
* `Bucket name prefix (for ONE_BUCKET_PER_VM only)` - prefix for bucket names used in amazon \(must be globally unique\), buckets will have names starting with this prefix - one for each VM 
* `Encryption` - enables build-in encryption of the data at rest. Once enabled, new data being stored is going to be encrypted. 
* `Resolve hostname to IP before connecting` - this forces vProtect to resolve IP if you're using on-prem S3-compatible storage with multiple nodes - DNS is supposed to point to a different host each time for load balancing
* `Path style access enabled` - some 3rd party S3 implementations need to use path-style access to objects - notice that AWS is going to deprecate it in the future
* `Region (optional)` - if you specify region, vProtect will search for the bucket in a particular region, otherwise vProtect uses global bucket access option and default region to access buckets in other regions

### Google Cloud Storage

* `Bucket name` - specified during bucket creation \(your buckets can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/)\),
* `Service account key` - paste content of service account key .json file. 

### Microsoft Azure

* `Account name` - account name used to access container
* `Account key` - account key used to access container
* `Encryption` - enables build-in encryption of the data at rest. Once enabled, new data being stored is going to be encrypted. 

### OpenStack Swift

* `Authentication URL` - v2 URL pointing to authentication service
* `User name` - username:tenant formatted username used by vProtect to log into OpenStack Swift
* `Password` - password used by vProtect to log into OpenStack Swift
* `Authentication method` - BASIC / TEMPAUTH / KEYSTONE
* `Segment no. length` - object name format to adress all segments \(i.e. 5 implies maximum of 99999 segments for an object\)
* `Segment size` - size of data segment into which data is being fragmented when sending to Swift
