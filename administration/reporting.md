# Reporting

## Main Dashboard

We also created for our users some reporting features. You can reach to them from main dashboard under section "Backup Statistics" through ![](../.gitbook/assets/icon-details.jpg) button

At the beginning you should see the summary page.:

From here, you can set a date range or go to a detailed summary of each of the four categories.
