# Policies

Policies allow you to group [backup](virtual-environments-backup.md), [snapshot management](vm-snapshot-management.md) or [restore](vm-recovery-plans.md)-related settings for multiple VMs. In general VM can have at most only one backup and one snapshot management policy to always have easy-to-interpret configuration,

You also can refer to your VM in Recovery Plans in multiple rules so that the same backup can be restored differently depending on your case - on-demand when actual disaster occurred, or periodically by schedule.
